Given a 2D array binaryMatrix of 0s and 1s, implement a function getNumberOfIslands that returns the number of islands of 1s in binaryMatrix.

An island is defined as a group of adjacent values that are all 1s. A cell in binaryMatrix is considered adjacent to another cell if they are next to each either on the same row or column. Note that two values of 1 are not part of the same island if they’re sharing only a mutual “corner” (i.e. they are diagonally neighbors).

Explain and code the most efficient solution possible and analyze its time and space complexities.

Example:

input:  binaryMatrix = [ [0,    1,    0,    1,    0],
                         [0,    0,    1,    1,    1],
                         [1,    0,    0,    1,    0],
                         [0,    1,    1,    0,    0],
                         [1,    0,    1,    0,    1] ]

output: 6 # since this is the number of islands in binaryMatrix.
          # See all 6 islands color-coded below.

export const getNumberOfIslands = (binaryMatrix: number[][]): number => {
  return 0
}

// Example usage:
const binaryMatrix = [
  [0, 1, 0, 1, 0],
  [0, 0, 1, 1, 1],
  [1, 0, 0, 1, 0],
  [0, 1, 1, 0, 0],
  [1, 0, 1, 0, 1],
]

// console.log(getNumberOfIslands(binaryMatrix)) // Output: 6
